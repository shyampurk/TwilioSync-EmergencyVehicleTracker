# TwilioSync Emergency Vehicle Tracker

A model application to simulate the control of traffic signal for ensuring priority movement of emergency vehicles


## Introduction
This is the accompanying source code for the Twilio Sync demonstration for controlling a traffic signal for ensuring priority movement of emergency vehicles within the city. In this demo we have used a raspberry pi 3 as the traffic signal and the emergency vehicle movement is simulated through a script. Twilio sync enables the state and information orchestration between the traffic signal and emergency vehicle.
